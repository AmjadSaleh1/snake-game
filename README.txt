The Classic Snake Game

This is a simple, classic Snake game built in Python using the Turtle graphics library.
Developed as part of a course on Udemy, this project recreates the well-known 
game where players control a snake to collect food and grow in length while avoiding collisions with the walls and the snake’s own tail.

How to Run:
Make sure you have Python installed.
Install the required modules (Turtle is built into Python’s standard library).
